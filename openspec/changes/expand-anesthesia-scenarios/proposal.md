# Expand the anesthesia scenario library

## Why

The engine specification requires at least 12 bundled scenarios across routine and emergency
anesthesia. The alpha proved the platform with 4 scenarios, but it left major code-addressable
coverage gaps once the external face-validity gate was treated as provisionally passed.

The first increment was unexpected intraoperative hemorrhage. The second is rapid-sequence
induction: the smallest case that turns the existing train-of-four state and declared airway
duration into a learner decision about preoxygenation, neuromuscular-block onset, and the time
spent without ventilation.

## What changes

- Add a fifth scenario covering recognition of compensated hemorrhage and initial crystalloid
  temporization during emergency laparotomy.
- Add learner-delivered balanced crystalloid with a fixed 25% intravascular-retention teaching
  model, input validation, event logging, deterministic replay, and a working cockpit tray.
- Track circulating hemoglobin mass so whole-blood loss preserves concentration and retained
  crystalloid causes dilution.
- Evaluate the new scenario's objectives from the recorded actions and map them to the supported
  curriculum frameworks.
- State the boundary plainly: no blood products, coagulopathy, calcium, laboratory guidance,
  source-control action, team behavior, or massive-transfusion protocol is simulated.
- Add a sixth scenario covering rapid-sequence induction in a full-stomach adult with an otherwise
  straightforward airway.
- Add rocuronium as a bolus-only teaching model that drives quantitative train-of-four count and
  ratio, with no hypnotic, analgesic, or direct hemodynamic effect.
- Make laryngoscopy consume its declared simulated time and evaluate whether the learner waited
  for modeled block onset while preserving the oxygen margin.
- State the second boundary plainly: reversal, emergence, extubation, regurgitation, aspiration,
  cricoid pressure, and difficult-airway rescue remain unavailable.

## Impact

These two slices close the hemorrhage, obstetric-presentation, and rapid-sequence-induction gaps
and make previously inert physiology actionable. They do not complete the bundled-library,
neuromuscular-reversal, or crisis-injector requirements.
