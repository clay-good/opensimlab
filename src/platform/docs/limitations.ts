      + 'ventilation, or a desaturation that real positive end-expiratory pressure would fix.',
    correctUnderstanding: 'Positive end-expiratory pressure recruits collapsed alveoli and '
      + 'reduces shunt, and at the same time raises intrathoracic pressure and can drop cardiac '
      + 'output. Here it does neither, so it will not rescue a saturation and will not cost you '
      + 'a blood pressure.',

    simplification: 'Regional anaesthesia and block spread are not modelled at all.',

      + 'or the recovery. Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity cannot be simulated either.',

      + 'here about opioid dosing transfers to a patient with a block in place.',

      + 'management as much as volume does.',
    correctUnderstanding: 'In real major haemorrhage the clotting is often the problem, and '
      + 'replacing volume without addressing it makes the bleeding worse.',
    briefIn: [],

  {
    id: 'acid-base-approximate',
    simplification: 'Acid-base compensation is approximated by the carbon dioxide model alone. '
      + 'There is no metabolic component, no base excess, and no renal compensation.',

      + 'metabolic acidosis would be driving the respiratory pattern.',
    correctUnderstanding: 'Arterial carbon dioxide is one axis of acid-base status. A normal '

  {
    id: 'no-fresh-gas-flow',
    simplification: 'Fresh gas flow is not modelled, so volatile wash-in does not change with flow '
      + 'and there is no circuit rebreathing.',
    whereItMisleads: 'Learning low-flow anaesthesia, or understanding why a vaporizer setting takes '
      + 'so much longer to reach the alveolus at 0.5 L/min than at 8 L/min.',
    correctUnderstanding: 'At low fresh gas flow the circuit concentration lags the dial setting '

    whereItMisleads: 'Anything about intubating conditions, residual blockade, or reversal. The '
      + 'airway model here assumes conditions that a blocker would normally provide.',
    correctUnderstanding: 'Extubating below a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 is residual blockade, and '
      + 'a qualitative twitch assessment cannot exclude it. None of that is exercised here.',

  {
    id: 'interaction-coefficient-calibrated',

      + 'remifentanil concentration spares.',

      + 'called, when, and what you said.',
